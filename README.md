This is an SDL2 Puzzle Bobble-like game I built in 2015.

All code is in C++, and all resources included are 
products of my own work at home. Notable exception
are the musical themes (title.ogg, ingame.ogg and 
about.ogg) which are (c) [Purple-planet music] and thus
are included in this repository as stub (empty) files.
Feel free to substitute with your own music files.

This game was compiled as a library and used through
the Android NDK in the PuzzBob App in Google Appstore.

The game is not platform-specific, it should compile and
play in Windows, Linux and Android machines when the
appropriate framework is present.
